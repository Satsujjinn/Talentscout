## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Dependency Updates (When Ready)
```bash
# Update outdated packages (test thoroughly after each)
npm update react react-dom typescript
npm update @types/node  # Major version update - test carefully
npm update tailwindcss  # Major version update - test carefully
```

### 2. Enhanced Testing Strategy
