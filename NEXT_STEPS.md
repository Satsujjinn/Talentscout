## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Performance Optimization (Optional)
```bash
# Address the remaining performance warnings
# Replace <img> tags with Next.js <Image> component in:
# - src/app/dashboard/requests/components/MatchRequestCard.tsx

# Update outdated packages (test thoroughly after each)
npm update react react-dom typescript
npm update @types/node  # Major version update - test carefully
npm update tailwindcss  # Major version update - test carefully
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
```bash
# Add to your CI/CD pipeline:
# - Automated linting on PR
# - TypeScript compilation check
# - Build verification
# - Security audit
```

### 4. Code Quality Monitoring
```bash
# Set up pre-commit hooks for:
# - ESLint
# - TypeScript checking
# - Format checking (Prettier)
```

### 5. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Consider adding:
# - Unit tests for critical components
# - Integration tests for API routes
# - E2E tests for user flows
