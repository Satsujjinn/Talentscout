# GitHub Repository Setup

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click the "+" icon in the top right
4. Select "New repository"
5. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `talent-scout-za`
   - **Description**: `A modern talent scouting platform connecting athletes with recruiters in South Africa`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (you already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (you already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Copy the repository URL, which will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/talent-scout-za.git
```

### 3. Run These Commands

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/talent-scout-za.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Setup

After pushing, run:
```bash
./setup-deployment.sh
```

This should now show "âœ… Git remote configured" instead of the error.

1. **Set up Clerk Authentication**

3. **Choose a Database Provider**
4. **Deploy to Vercel**
